           SKYBORNE EXPRESS – DOCK 7, MIDNIGHT SHIFT
        ──────────────────────────────────────────────

        Engines purr in the dark. Rain taps Morse on the hull. Six bookings tonight. All flagged 
        "priority." None look honest.

        Every slip has a name, an item, a quantity, and a cost. The system only trusts *exact* 
        entries. One wrong letter, one wrong digit, and a lie can hide in plain sight.

        [Radio crackle]

        DISPATCH: "Captain, heads up. HQ got a tip: one shipment's manifest is fraudulent. 
        Its price looks wrong on paper — not by much, but enough to put a target on our backs 
        if we load it."

        DISPATCH: "They like to talk, these six. Listen to what they say about each other, 
        cargo gossip's cheaper than insurance."

        DISPATCH: "And a few of them are fond of riddles now, for some reason. Note those too. 
        Between price, loose tongues, and riddles, you’ll spot the liar."

        You flip your clipboard open, pen hovering over the first line.

        Tonight, you *know* one shipment is lying. Your job is to find it and remove it before 
        the ramp closes.

        If something goes wrong tonight, your signature’s on it.

        The hangar doors hiss open and a wall of muscle stomps through the rain. Tank top, duffel bag, 
        and an expression like the weather offended him.

        "BRO," he grunts. "Just got back from Mexico. Don't ask. DO. NOT. ASK."

        He drags his crate like it insulted his mother and lets it slam onto the deck.

        Bulk Ryker: "Protein Infusion Canisters. Four units. Cost: two hundred. Best deal on the dock, bro. 
        Nobody gets them cheaper than me."

        The number catches your ear. You’ve seen similar canisters. They never come that cheap by a long shot.

        Bulk jerks his chin toward the programmer pacing near the back.

        Bulk Ryker: "But that programmer kid, Linton? Bro jitters like he drank twelve energy drinks 
        and forgot to breathe. Always muttering, eyes all bugged out. I wouldn’t trust him alone 
        with my gym bag, let alone a shipment."

        He cracks his neck, smirks, then adds:

        He waddles in under a rain-slick jacket that does not quite close over his belly, 
        clutching a brown bottle of dock beer.

        Buck: "Back when I was young, crates were honest. Beer was cheaper. Knees didn't hurt. Anyway, here's mine."

        He eases the crate down with a wheezy grunt.

        Buck: "Classic Ale Keg. One unit. Cost: ninety. Standard issue. Back when I was young, that would've 
        been thirty. But hey, inflation."

        The number sounds right. Nothing unusual there.

        He nods toward the conspiracy theorist, still clutching his notebook like evidence.

        Buck: "That Vesper boy? Smells like excuses, same scent my disappointing son used to drag 
        around after missing shift again. Hell, the kid even slouches the same. 
        But underneath all that jitter and talk of lights and triangles, he's solid. 
        If my ex-wife had given me custody, I reckon I'd've raised someone a lot like him
        rough edges, weird stories, but a good heart shoved in there anyway."

        Buck leans closer, voice dropping to a tipsy hush.

        Buck: "Here’s a little brain teaser for you, Captain:

            'What has numbers but no weight,

        He drifts out of the mist like he was poured from it. Coat salt-stained, 
        eyes cloudy, steps slow and sure.

        Ripple: "Evening, Captain. Sea spat me back out with a job to finish. 
        Funny thing ’bout tides—what leaves always comes back, unless it doesn’t. 
        Circle of something… you know."

        clearly convinced he’s just shared ancient ocean wisdom instead of damp confusion.

        Ripple: "Net-Stabilizer Kit. Two units. Cost: one hundred twenty."

        You’ve seen the same kits listed closer to one-eighty. His price feels… light.

        Ripple watches the big man pace grooves into the hangar floor.

        Ripple: "Bulk walks like a bar fight looking for a table to break. Loud voice, louder footsteps, 
        never still. That kind of energy capsizes calm crews. I’ve seen whole voyages sink on men like him."

        He listens to the rain for a long moment, then adds, softer, like a tide going out:

        The rain slackens. The hangar lights buzz. You plant the six slips on the crate and listen.

        The mail pouch at your hip thrums—soft, then sharp— like a tuning fork near a lie.

        One shipment’s description isn’t honest.

        Some costs rang low. Some tongues pointed fingers. Some riddles curled around something nastier 
        than wordplay.

        You scan the names, the items, the quantities, the costs. Somewhere in the ink, one bad entry 
        waits to take the fall.

        Review the entries and delete the suspect's delivery:

        The pouch on your hip gives one clean, steady hum a truth-note.

        You flip the final slip over, scribble your signature, and the hangar exhales with you.

        DISPATCH (radio): "Captain, HQ confirms it. Good call. That could’ve cost the entire dock."

        A soft clunk echoes as the loading clamps lock. Engines spool, hungry to leave.

        Bulk finally stops pacing. 
        Buck raises his bottle in a tired salute. 
        Ripple closes his eyes and listens to a storm that never arrives. 
        Bramble finaly stops staring at the wall.
        Vesper scans the sky for triangles and, for once, finds none. 
        Linton’s crate sits untouched, danger filed under 'averted.'

        Tonight, nothing blows up, phases out, lies, or sings.

        You earned your lift-off.

        ✔ Manifest cleared  
        ✔ Shipment secured  
        ✔ Captain intact  

        Victory feels like a hangar finally going still.

        The pouch on your hip screeches—short, sharp, unmistakably wrong.

        Before you can flip the slip back over, the crate beside you *ticks* out of rhythm.

        Someone shouts. Something hums. Everything goes sideways.

        A flash of light bleeds through the metal like fog through fingers. 
        The air screams and the hangar lights pop, one by one.

        DISPATCH (radio, panicked): "Captain—Captain?!  
        You cleared the wrong manifest. Back away—"

        But it’s too late.

        The shipment you passed wasn’t honest. 
        And tonight, honesty was the only shield you had.

        ✖ Manifest falsified  
        ✖ HQ breach reported  
        ✖ Plane compromised  

        The hangar falls silent, except for the rain
        tapping your mistake into the floor.
