## Overview
Welcome aboard, Captain.

You've just received word that **one of the six packages on your manifest is fraudulent**. Your mission is clear: identify the fake delivery and remove it before your airship departs.

Question your customers, analyze the clues, and make the right choice — or face the consequences.

## The Suspects
Your manifest contains deliveries for six customers:

- **Bulk Ryker** — A loud lifter with impossible discounts  
- **Buck Hawthorne** — Easygoing, but vague  
- **Old Man Ripple** — Talks more than he answers  
- **Bramble Nett** — Sharp as a thorn  
- **Vesper Morrow** — Odd, quiet, noticeable  
- **Linton Yarrow** — Nervous, fidgety, and suspicious  

**One of them is not who they claim to be. Can you figure out which one?**
